## Phoenix Project Summary

### Concepts
The Phoenix Project is a wonderful introduction to several key concepts.

### The Four Types of Work
Erik starts by sending Bill on a journey to uncover the four types of IT work. Bill identifies the first three types reasonably quickly but finds the fourth type more elusive. It isn’t until the damaging nature of the fourth type is understood that the team can start to turn the tide.
- The first type of work is `Business Projects`, which help drive business processes and initiatives. These generally involve new features aimed at providing new capabilities or efficiencies for customers. These are driven by business leaders and can be managed as projects, and are usually not tracked centrally, but instead managed by individual budget owners.
- The second type of work is `Internal Projects`. These are generally smaller bits of regular work that accumulates over time: maintenance and upgrades of existing systems, retiring old technology, security patches, and so on. This is the work that keeps the company functioning. These can also be planned and run in a queue of work.
- `Changes` are the third type of work and encompass bug fixes, version changes, and any improvements that are generated by the first two types of work. These are the routine updates and support that arise from the simple existence of more applications and infrastructure.
- The fourth and most damaging type, `Unplanned Work`, is work that is necessary because other work needs to be redone, and it throws different types of work into chaos. This is the insidious, invisible work that makes other planned commitments impossible to meet because it slows or blocks other kinds of work. Due to its detrimental effect on the other three types, Unplanned Work needs to be avoided at all costs.
The point of this journey is to make it clear to Bill that making work visible is the first step in starting to make sense of it all. If existing commitments across the organization are not understood, it can’t be coordinated to ensure that the priorities of the broader company are being met.

### Work in Process (WIP)
Erik teaches Bill that WIP is one of the root causes of chronic problems with delivery and quality. Failure to control WIP results in the slow, inevitable death of productivity within organizations.
The Phoenix Project is a study of how concepts like Lean Manufacturing or the Toyota Production System are much more pertinent to modern software development than most software engineering professionals may think. This has proven to be accurate as a generation of software engineers have adopted those ideas and made considerable gains in terms of productivity and quality. Many Agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, incorporate these concepts as well.
WIP boils down to focus — or lack thereof. Instead of working on multiple things at once, work on one thing at a time, and do it well the first time. That way, fewer mistakes are made, and the less work needs to be redone. Any action that has to be repeated is deemed “waste” because the work performed the first time must be discarded. Lean is organized around the idea that organizations should continuously reduce waste so that the resources saved from that can be redirected to other endeavours, such as making the process more efficient, improve tools and procedures, and conduct experiments to create new features or products.
The Phoenix Project just scratches the surface of Lean, as it merely demonstrates how these practices can be applied to software development.

### Kanban Boards
Bill and his colleagues eventually counteract the effects of excessive WIP by creating kanbans around their teams, thereby making work visible and allowing them to prioritize the most valuable work. In particular, Brent’s time is carefully guarded so that he can work on the right task.
Kanban roughly translates to “signboard” in Japanese. The basic idea is to create an easily visible board with every phase of your process marked from left to right. Each work item is represented by a card associated with the person(s) doing the work. As the work gets completed, the card moves to the right until the work it represents is completed.
The idea is that making work visible allows the team to see the big picture around the work being done. Doing so makes the process very easy to follow, fosters better collaboration, and makes WIP very obvious.

### Ten Deployments Per Day
As the efficiency gains and improvements to the development pipeline accumulate, the Parts Unlimited team gets to the point where they can deliver much faster than the quarterly releases they started out with. However, ten per day still seems out of reach to the team. Eventually, they come to realize that small increments of work that are delivered frequently allow the company to maximize throughput and creates the flexibility to respond to customer demand quickly.
“Ten deploys per day” is a famous rallying-cry of the DevOps movement. It refers to the ability to deploy changes to production multiple times per day, as opposed to quarterly, monthly, or weekly. It’s not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a milestone indicating that an organization is on its way to reaching a competitive pace of delivering changes into a system. Unicorn companies such as Amazon and Google are famous for releasing thousands or hundreds of thousands of times per day.
One nuance is that this doesn’t necessarily mean actual deployments, but rather the ability to. Continuously deploying may be rare with new features, but bug fixes or critical patches are kinds of updates that need to flow through the system quickly and safely.
Overall, The Phoenix Project lightly touches on this concept by illustrating the problems that arise when deployments are a significant undertaking versus smooth-flowing work when this milestone is achieved.

### The Theory of Constraints
It isn’t until Bill begins to grasp The Theory of Constraints (TOC) that he begins to point the organization in the right direction. This is because many of the remedial actions his group takes are only temporary — without changing the way that the org works, the same problems will eventually occur.
By applying the TOC, they identify the actual bottlenecks in the system and introduce the practices and processes to continually improve the flow of work and shift to a more strategic approach.
The TOC can be broken down as the continual identification and removal of bottlenecks in any given system. To be able to apply this, an understanding of the system itself must be acquired, which means understanding each step in the process. This is deceptively hard because these steps are often hidden in peoples’ heads. Until those steps are listed, understood, and mapped out in a sequence, it’s tough to establish a repeatable process that results in consistency and quality.
A practice called value-stream mapping is often the first step in applying the TOC. This is precisely what Bill and his colleagues use to understand the flow of the work. From there, they are able to unblock the system enough to accelerate the flow of the work.

### The Three Ways
Erik spends much of the book mentoring Bill through the understanding and application of The Three Ways, which is the underlying model that makes The Phoenix Project so powerful.
One of the authors describes The Three Ways as:
```
…the principles that all of the DevOps patterns can be derived from, which we’re using in both the “DevOps Handbook” and “The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win.” We assert that the Three Ways describe the values and philosophies that frame the processes, procedures, practices of DevOps, as well as the prescriptive steps.
```
To understanding the model, imagine all work, from inception to delivery of the final product, as a series of steps that flows from left to right. This work represents the delivery of any value to customers. The notion of “value” is fluid: it can be an app, a service, a physical product — basically, anything that a customer finds useful. This flow is referred to as the value stream.
The Three Ways are a way to approach maximization of value delivery by optimizing the value stream to the customer, gaining faster and deeper insights by putting monitoring mechanisms in place, and by improving and finding new values via experimentation.
The Three Ways can be broken down as:
- The First Way — Continuously find and implement ways to improve delivery. This is synonymous with the concept of Kaizen.

- The Second Way — Get fast feedback and work from strong failure signals to ever-weaker failure signals to get advance warning of quality issues.

- The Third Way — Use the efficiencies gained in The First Way and the safety enforced by The Second Way to introduce rapid experiments that help create qualitative gains.
The idea is that by following The Three Ways, your company will outpace competitors by orders of magnitude and will win in the marketplace by creating value for customers superior to its competitors.
